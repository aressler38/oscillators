Oscillators
===========

This is a simple demonstration of the Web Audio API. 
Users are able to create, connect, and disconnect oscillators.
There is one tool bar that governs any variable parameters for a 
selected AudioNode. The tool bar also provides the ability to 
create new oscillator and gain nodes.
